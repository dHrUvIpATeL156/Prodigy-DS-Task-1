#**Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis Insights**
Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository documents are for Task 1 of my internship journey, focusing on data cleaning, analysis, and uncovering insightful patterns.
#**Task Overview**
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the disctribution of ages or genders in a population.
#**Extracting Top 10 Countries by Total Population**
The data was filtered to include only rows where the 'Series Code' is 'SP.POP.TOTL', which represents the total population.
The filtered data was then sorted by population in descending order, allowing the identification of the top 10 countries with the highest total population.
